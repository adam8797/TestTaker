For this project, I decided to take an approach which I already know is overkill.

Some points that I thought I should mention:

1. I designed an MVC-ish framework upon which I could build the Survey/Test application. It knows nothing about questions/tests/responses or anything like that. It was desinged in a near vacuum.

2. I took a Repository based approach to data storage. As a consequence of that, the models probably resemble database models. In fact SQL storage would be very easy here.

3. I made heavy use of Java Generics, so you'll see Ts on a lot of the Framework classes. I've tried to label them all, as to not confuse.

I've included four different images, all UML generated by IntelliJ:

All.png -- All classes in the project including both Framework and App classes. Also contains notes.
App.png -- All classes related to the survey app. Includes Questions, Responses, and things of that nature. This is more the core of the assignment.
MVC.png -- All classes related to the MVC-ish framework.

If you're only going to look at one, All.png is the best bet. All contain the same information, but I thought it was easier to read when App and MVC were separated.

There are still quite a few things I don't like about it, but I can't spend any more time tweaking it.
